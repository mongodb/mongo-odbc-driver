{"firstIssued": "2024-06-05T15:32:43Z", "state": "not_affected", "justification": "code_not_reachable", "detail": "This is only an issue for IDP using the RSA crate. The openid connect library on the client side does not decrypt or sign with the private key. In particular, this is how the attack works: `The attacker sends specially crafted RSA ciphertexts to a server using the vulnerable rsa crate and measures the time it takes for the server to process the messages. By analyzing the timing information, the attacker can deduce the padding scheme used by the server, which ultimately reveals the private key`. Additionally, the openidconnect library does not use decrypt, and our usage of the library does not use sign."}
